    "List comprehensions give python developers a concise way to create lists from other lists or iterables. They are easy to read, execute quickly, and feel right at home in python. But this isn't the only way to create a new list from a sequence. Like many languages, python supports lambda functions, or anonymous functions. There are ways to use familiar functional programming calls, such as `map`, in combination with lambdas to generate new lists. Let's look at what they both are and then see if either have a performance advantage."
